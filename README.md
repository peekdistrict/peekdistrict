We're here to collaboratively report, identify, and track the location of CCTV cameras.

They're meant to add a sense of security. Would you rather park you car or bike near one?

If something goes wrong, getting access to the footage could help you. If something DOES go wrong, does a CCTV camera help you?

The UK holds the largest concentration of CCTV cameras on the planet, and yet cameras have increased in many aspects of our lives, across the globe.

Who watches the watchers?

### We're starting using: 
    * [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about)
    * OSM tag [surveillance](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dsurveillance) and the [initial proposal](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Surveillance) for the use of the tag
    
### How to Contribute (draft)

1. [Create an OSM account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)

#### TBD
    * Code of Conduct
    * Collaborative map layer
    * Look at possible inegrations of GPS - I've used [ODK](https://opendatakit.org) previously. It also has an [Android only phone app](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/)
