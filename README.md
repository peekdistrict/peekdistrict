We're here to collaboratively report, identify, and track the location of CCTV Surveillance cameras.

They're meant to add a sense of security. Would you rather park you car or bike near one?

If something goes wrong, getting access to the footage could help you. If something DOES go wrong, does a CCTV camera help you?

The UK holds the largest concentration of CCTV cameras on the planet, and yet cameras have increased in many aspects of our lives, across the globe. 2013 estimates show UK coverage at 5.9 Million (1 camera for every 11 people).

Who watches the watchers?

By opening up this collaborative data we hope to improve public awareness; of state and corporate monitoring, and to enable these devices to work for our benefit through greater transparency and accountability.

### We're starting using: 
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about)
OSM tag [surveillance](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:man_made%3Dsurveillance) and the hashtags #PeekDistrict #MozSprint. For more details on the use of this OSM tag read the [initial proposal](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Surveillance) on the wiki.

Some of you might be asking '[Why use OpenStreetMap](http://geoawesomeness.com/why-would-you-use-openstreetmap-if-there-is-google-maps/)'? Aleks explains rather nicely.
    
### How to Contribute

[Contribution Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

This forms this basis of our intended work, mapping surveillance cameras. You might have skills which can help improve the storytelling, workflow, documentation, design, toolset, etc - in which case, please create an issue or fork and submit your improvements

The OSM tag we are using is `man_made=surveillance`, the hashtags (for OSM data comments and social media) #PeekDistrict and #MozSprint.
